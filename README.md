## Introduction

The script allows you to control/check your FritzBox from the terminal with a shell script. It is planned to add more functions in the future.
The shell script uses cURL to create an SOAP request based on the TR-064 protocol to talk to the AVM Fritz!Box and AVM Fritz!Repeater.


If you want to check out if your AVM device actually works with this script, you can do so by executing `fritzBoxShellTest.sh`. It prints for (almost) every Service/Action pair if they delivered data when called.


As an example - the result for my Fritz!Box:

```
WLAN_2G STATISTICS43	is working!
WLAN_2G STATE6	is working!
WLAN_5G STATISTICS43	is working!
WLAN_2G STATE6	is working!
WLAN STATE12	is working!
LAN STATE8	is working!
DSL STATE0	is not working!
WAN STATE16	is working!
LINK STATE0	is not working!
IGDWAN STATE28	is working!
IGDDSL STATE15	is working!
IGDIP STATE48	is working!
NewModelName FRITZ!Box 6490 Cable (kdg)
NewSoftwareVersion 141.06.87
```

## Installing, configuring and first script execution

Head over to the Wiki pages to get all the information: https://github.com/jhubig/FritzBoxShell/wiki/Installation,-Configuration-&-First-test

## Arguments/Enviroments

You can use variables or arguments. However, arguments are visible in the process list and are therefore not recommended for passwords.

If these arguments or environment variables are not set, then the values from the fritzBoxShellConfig.sh are used.

Here an example (This will enable the 2.4 Ghz network on the box with the following IP):

`./fritzBoxShell.sh --boxip 192.168.178.1 --boxuser foo --boxpw baa WLAN_2G 1`

| Enviroment | Argument | Description |
|---|---|---|
| BoxIP | --boxip | IP or DNS of FritzBox |
| BoxUSER | --boxuser | Username |
| BoxPW | --boxpw | Login password for user. |
| RepeaterIP | --repeaterip | IP or DNS of FritzRepeater |
| RepeaterUSER | --repeateruser | Usually on Fritz!Repeater no User is existing. Can be left empty. |
| RepeaterPW | --repeaterpw | Password for user. |
